","Improve the auto-matching of two types of electronic documents originated from independent information source. Two different types of electronic documents will undergo a matching process by a computer program to identify outstanding submission every day.  Contents of the common input fields in these two document types will be compared character by character for matching.  For those unmatched document records, officers have to refine the matching criteria, sometimes based on typo correction, to perform manual on-line matching again.  For records remained outstanding after going through the auto- and manual matching, officers will issue notice, either electronically or in paper format, to the party concerned for follow-up.  The project aims to enhance the existing system by using artificial intelligence, machine learning or other technology to identify the outstanding submission.. The enhancement should be able to minimize the human effort in the manual matching process.  With the enhanced system, the whole process can be shortened to boost efficiency and increase the matching rate."

","Monitoring of Illegal Dumping on Smart Lampposts. There are public concerns on using cameras as it may touch on personal privacy.  Therefore technologies alternative to cameras will be explored which are privacy-friendly to monitoring illegal dumping activities.. Illegal Dumping Monitoring
-	Collect information for planning and operation against illegal dumping activities
-	Record and identify illegal waste dumping activities in the street and track street obstructions such as recyclers shops and waste collection vehicles obstacles in selected area of interest
-	Identify dumping type (e.g. by hand, with vehicle, with trolley)
-	Automatically measure the volume and type of waste captured if illegal waste dumping is suspected
-	Recognise the vehicle licence plate number
-	Automatically track and analyse vehicles and the corresponding vehicle type:
> Motor Cycle
> Private Car
> Taxi
> Private Light Bus
> Public Light Bus
> Light Goods Vehicle
> Medium / Heavy Goods Vehicle
> Non-franchised Bus
> Franchised Bus (single decker)
> Franchised Bus (double decker)
-	Types of Trash (for reference):
> Earth Filling, building debris (packed and not packed in bags)
> Household waste
> Waste Tyre
> Air conditioner
> Refrigerator
> Washing machine
> Television
> Computer
> Printer
> Scanner
> Monitor
> Bamboo
> Cardboard, carton box
> Gas Cylinder (Fire Extinguishers, Air conditioner compressor, refrigerants)
> Wardrobes, drawers
> Bed, mattress, cabinets
> Basin, toilet bowl
> Wooden frame
> Big Trash Bag
-	Alert and Reporting
> Trigger an email alert on the event time and venue in Backend instantly if illegal waste dumping is suspected
> Trigger alert should have information for user preview and verify the suspected activities
> Log the illegal dumping event in the backend system and provide both web and mobile client to access report system
-	Provide a live view at the scene
-	Alternative technologies other than cameras which are privacy-friendly (i.e. no excessive data collection principle under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and the practice of collecting minimum information for the purpose of data collection) should be considered only.
