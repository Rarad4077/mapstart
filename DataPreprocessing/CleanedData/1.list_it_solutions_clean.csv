Esri China (HK) is honored to be awarded the SOA-QPS by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) since 2005. 

Cloud platforms and geographic information systems (GIS) software together give businesses the ability to analyze massive amounts of information. ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Pro, Operations Dashboard for ArcGIS, Collector for ArcGIS, Survey 123 are all part of the Esri Geospatial Cloud. The resultant location intelligence often reveals deeper insights and innovative ways to increase efficiency. With a geospatial cloud, one can create maps that represent thousands of relationships between hundreds of layers of data on demographics, sales, population growth, likely customers, competitors, supply chains, delivery routes, and countless other variables. The Esri Geospatial Cloud enables national, state, and local governments to map critical issues, from health to crime to utility lines. It supports the work of nongovernmental organizations involved in environmental issues, addressing social justice concerns and crisis response for natural disasters. A geospatial cloud also allows location intelligence data to be easily combined with artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to map out ways to drive productivity or adjust strategies before bigger problems develop.

Our Professional Service Team had worked with over 30 HKSAR Government departments for over 20 years and had developed a thorough understanding of the departments’ requirement and procedures. In fact, developed as a common data environment for collecting, managing, analyzing and sharing of geospatial information, the ArcGIS platform has been widely adopted as the standard GIS software in many governmental departments such as Lands Department, Planning Department, Housing Department, Hong Kong Police Force, Fire Services Department, Water Supplies Department, Highways Department, and Transport Department.","Broadcasting

","The Esri Geospatial Cloud can empower government departments to run more efficiently and make better decisions in public services. Some examples as below:

Development Bureau / Related Departments
GIS can help identify areas of interest in land development by incorporating smart city components through map overlay analysis on base map, 3D terrain, utility pipeline asset and other location information. The common information sharing platform for surveyors, engineers and urban planners in various departments leads to informed policy making such as avoiding developing areas with high flood frequency that may unlikely attract residents. Spatial information is made easily accessible across departments in a digital space known as common data environment (CDE). 

Security Bureau/ Related Departments
ArcGIS provides a real-time platform for emergency response on a Common Operational Picture for cross departmental cooperation. Designed for major event planning and monitoring, Operations Dashboard for ArcGIS provides a timely summary of what is happening in a designated area.  Information from various sources such as location of key targets, moving vehicles can all be viewed on the same web or mobile map. Frontline officers are able to take prompt and accurate decisions when handling accidents and emergency situations. 

Environment Bureau/ Related Departments
On a common Web GIS platform, Environment Bureau can consolidate and visualize a vast amount of environmental information in 2D/3D format collected by GPS-enabled mobile devices in different divisions under the Environmental Protection Department. The Web GIS platform also provides analytical functions for GIS data manipulation across the department with security control on the access rights to some sensitive and/or classified data for internal process.

Food and Health Bureau/ Related Departments
Web GIS / Mobile GIS platform is a cross departmental information sharing platform which redefines the way governments approach health and human services workflows. Spatial analysis can uncover significant patterns or trends that provide a broader context for further investigation. Combining this spatial data platform with other crucial details is a powerful way to expose the issues involved in food and health. Public health uses of GIS include tracking child immunization, conducting health policy research, and establishing service areas and districts. GIS provides a way to move data from the project level to policy-making level so that it can be used by the entire Bureau.

Transport and Housing Bureau/ Related Departments
Using GIS and building relationships to gather and visualize available data on housing and other urban conditions could make evidence-based policies that affect public housing and transport. Building on a cross-departmental information sharing platform, advanced GIS spatial analysis empowers housing authorities to make informed decisions, resulting in better housing policy and identify the most suitable development opportunities on a common spatial analytics platform across multiple departments. GIS can help in achieving excellence in transportation as well. It significantly aids in planning, monitoring and managing complex systems involved in transportation planning and management more effectively. GIS helps in determining capacity enhancements, improving operations, asset management and identifying the most strategic investments for the transportation system in marine ports, air terminals, railways, as well as roads and highways.",www.esrichina.hk

","Falling is considered the most common source of injury amongst the elderly population. Approximately 30%-50% of falls cause minor injuries such as bruises and abrasions, and around 10% result in major injuries, including fractures and brain injury-related deaths. Elderly centers have been actively trying to prevent the falls, but accidents do happen and an immediate response could avoid the situation to worsen. The existing solution to this problem is the ‘safety bell’ that requires elderlies to always wear it on their necks and push the button whenever there is an emergency- such as they have fallen. Although the device could instantly contact nearby hospitals and inform police stations, it is largely dependent on Elderlies pushing the button, hence when they are unconscious or thinking they could manage by themselves, will often delay the best time to receive medical treatments and worsening the situation. 

The falling alert aspect uses facial recognition that identifies the elderly, and key-point recognition that recognizes the body key-points such as joints, limbs etc hence knowing when there are irregular body movements causing a fall.

","HKSAR Government and its departments having strong demand on various logistics service and at the same time, HKSAR Post Office providing high quality courier service. Below we describe how ShipAny helps to increase efficiency and productivity:

A) HKSAR Post Office - Courier Service Provider for E-Commerce
Existing difficulties: 
HKSAR Post Office now provides high quality courier/post service with competitive pricing, specific for E-Commerce, but the market share is limited as there's missing channel to interconnect with E-commerce (logistics demand party). Besides, it is still required Merchant (the online store owner) to drop off parcel with long queuing which is a barrier for Merchants
How ShipAny increase efficiency and help:
ShipAny already provides full set of E-commerce/Online Store solution plugins for these online stores easily connect to multiple logistics couriers by a single click setup. For example, ShipAny provides plugins for famous E-commerce solution like OpenCart, Magento, Shopify, Shopline.... Once ShipAny able to connect to HKSAR Post Office system, all these E-commerce solution (and the online stores using this solution) will easy connect to HKSAR Post Office courier service and adopt the service with full automation. ShipAny brings HKSAR Post Office to the E-Commerce eco-system with hot connection and also bringing more new online stores (customers of Post Office) to Post Office

B) HKSAR Post Office - New Smart Locker and Convenient Store Service
Existing difficulties:
HKSAR Post Office now serving over thousands of registered letter/parcels (delivering to residential home) per month. It is well-known that the cost of delivering to residential home is very high and the receiver not always at home introducing extra cost.
How ShipAny increase efficiency and help:
ShipAny already connects to multiple smart locker provider like Pakpabox, E-link, Locker Life and convenient store like Circle-K. These lockers and convenient stores bring 7x24 service for end-user to pickup. This greatly reduce the workload and cost for delivering to residential home.
Besides, we also having experience to build smart locker networks. It maybe a good idea to build a HKSAR Post Office smart locker networks with the facilities provided by ShipAny logistics platform to bringing up demand and supply parties.

C) Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department - Fresh Food Delivery Service
Existing difficulties:
There're many local fresh food provider in HK (e.g. fish, vegetables from local farm). However, the supply chain of ""Direct-from-Farm"" from farm to real consumer is still missing to attract consumers purchasing fresh food from local food provider.
How ShipAny increase efficiency and help:
The key point of ""Direct-from-Farm"" is the chilling/temperature-controlled logistics service. ShipAny partners with HK Tier-1 chilling/temperature-controlled logistics service provider and we also operating chilling smart lockers. Purchasing fresh local food online and pickup at smart lockers with chilling/temperature-controlled near home becomes very easy. It also helps promoting local fresh food and lower carbon emission for purchasing food from local farm.

D) Government Logistics Department - Multiple Courier Choices
Existing difficulties:
Government Logistics Department is coordinating logistics service for other government departments. The demand of logistics demand may be bursty that Logistics Department cannot always fulfil all. It's not avoidable to outsource to external logistics service provider
How ShipAny increase efficiency and help:
ShipAny already connected to wide range of logistics service providers (domestics, chilling/frozen logistics, international, lockers, Circle-K). We provides one-stop logistics solution to save time for searching and prevent single logistics vendor locked-in. It is totally automated service equipped with real-time quotation, delivery tracking and waybill generation.

","In line with the Smart City vision of the HKSAR Government, making use of innovation and technology in the built environment is the key to achieving building energy efficiency and sustainable development. The smart city market is expected to grow continuously with the support of the Government, as highlighted in the recently released “Hong Kong Smart City Blueprint” (ITB, 2018). Besides the HKSAR Government has set an ambitious carbon intensity reduction target of 65% to 70% by 2030 using 2005 as the base, which is equivalent to 26% to 36% absolute reduction and a reduction to 3.3-3.8 tonnes on a per capita basis (EB, 2018). Given the dominance of air-conditioning (AC) systems in building energy consumption, and of buildings in Hong Kong’s overall energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ensuring AC systems are run at the highest possible energy efficiency is crucial to realisation of Hong Kong’s GHG emission reduction target. Greater utilisation of building data to serve this purpose is, therefore, a necessary strategy to take.

-Estimated a certain improvement of debt/revenue collection
-Estimated a certain reduction in the number of debtors
-Improvement in the debt finalisation rate and
-More timely revenue collection

The Social Value:
-Allow tax management authority to distinguish between taxpayers who has the capacity to pay but chose not to and those who are in genuine finaical hardship and require additional support. Both types of taxpayers require different approaches and responses and being able to know when to apply one response over the other is critical to a client centric approach.
-A more responsive and tailored approach to individual taxpayers will lead to more timely collection of revenue and reduction in debt across all tax lines, and additional revenue to fund essential services for HK citizens.

The Human Empowerment:
-Provide insights to ensure our staff to better understand individual taxpayer's circumstances and needs.
-Allow staff to be engaged in more interesting and value-adding activities, which will make a real difference to both taxpayers and revenue outcomes.",www.sap.com

Indeed, while we expect AI-based technology in the years ahead to fundamentally transform how public-sector employees get work done—eliminating some jobs, redesigning countless others, and even creating entirely new professions—it’s already changing the nature of many jobs and revolutionizing facets of government operations.

It’s highly unusual for a business improvement to increase speed, enhance quality and reduce costs at the same time, but cognitive technologies offer that tantalising possibility.","Broadcasting

Not only does it meet the Smart City Initiative by allowing greater convenience through innovation and technology, our solution also helps to tackle ticket scalping by Smart Contract implementation with a permanent tamper-proof ledger.  TicketME provides an option to the event organisers for managing ticket ownerships and transfers after initial sales, which is currently lacking, in terms of a more structured control system.","Recreation and Culture
","Blockchain
","One of the proposed use cases for TicketME is targeted at popular concerts held at the Hong Kong Coliseum. 

Consumer flow (for public sales): 
Similar to how consumers currently buy their tickets online, they will be able to purchase tickets via URBTIX.  There is an additional option of e-ticket delivery.  They will only need to input their HK mobile phone number or email address for the purchase.  Once transaction is confirmed, they will receive a activation link.  If they haven’t already downloaded an e-wallet, they will need to register with a provider with basic personal information.  Their e-ticket is instantly stored in their e-wallet once they can successfully answer a knowledge-authentication question.

If they need to transfer any e-tickets from the e-wallet, they simply one-time upgrade their e-wallet account by uploading additional identification documents (such as HKID) to the provider.  Once that is verified, they can transfer their e-tickets and collect the equivalent (or lower) value of their tickets from the recipient via their e-wallets.  Their recipient will receive a message, and they can choose to accept or reject this transfer.  If they choose to accept, the e-ticket will be sent to them and they can also choose to transfer this e-ticket to another recipient by uploading same identification documents if required.

To enter the concert, consumers simply execute their e-ticket and a dynamic QR code will be generated.  This is scanned by a Wi-Fi connected scanner and verified at entrance.  Each person will hold their own e-ticket.  Once the ticket is exercised, QR code cannot be generated and it is not valid for entry again.

Consumer flow (for internal subscription):
A specific web portal will be given to event sponsors to distribute to their audience.  These consumers will be able to access these allocated tickets and have the option of e-ticket delivery.  The same flow applies to these ticket holders, whereby they will receive a activation link and once an e-wallet is downloaded, they can access and transfer their e-tickets via the e-wallet.

Consumer benefits:
The whole flow is highly secured.  Authentication is required to open the activation link that grants consumer access to their e-tickets.  Additional identification is required to transfer tickets to others.  E-tickets are exercised via a dynamic QR code that cannot be forged or duplicated and sent to others.  Storage of data is minimized and encrypted with TicketME.  With blockchain’s permanent tamper-proof ledger, this information is transparent, time-stamped and traceable.
 
The whole experience is very simple.  Consumers can transfer e-tickets to family and friends without scheduling a time to meet up to exchange physical tickets.  And with each person holding their own e-ticket, they can enter the concert at their own schedule, there is no need to wait for others who are holding their tickets outside the venue.

The whole process is very smart.  Based on the needs of stakeholders and the public, various limitations can be set onto ticket transfer activities via Smart Contract. 

Consumer costs:
There will be a small handling fee for choosing the e-ticket option.  This fee is comparable to the registered mailing cost of physical tickets, but the benefits and conveniences of having a smart e-ticket will significantly outweigh the costs.",www.kositech.com.hk

Therefore it is necessary to develop a common EV charger infrastructure using a common protocol, which could cover chargers of various output power, mobile apps for control, flexible payment system, management and control platform, and with load management solution for power limited building, altogether combined in one integrated solution.  This notion serves the basic framework of evMega Smart Charger Infrastructure design and also provides a clear direction for our R&D work to cater for the smart mobility needs of our future smart city.

","1. ev Chargers of various types (AC/DC), socket types, mounting method, power output (from 7kw to 350kw) to satisfy requirements of different car parking environment serving both home charging and destination charging requirements.  Medium chargers can be installed in government building to serve the charging needs of their fleets of electric vehicle.  High power (super/ultra fast) chargers can be installed in public area to provide immediate charging services to citizens.
2. Use of common OCPP 1.60 (Open Charge Point Protocol version 1.6), an application protocol for communication between EV charging station and a central management system.   It supports smart charging control and management, load balancing, multi-payment, big data sharing, JSON client/server communication protocol for more secure and faster connection.  In particular, (a) For charging station owners, it provides greater choice and flexibility; (b) For users, the protocol encourages charging stations to compete on price, service, product features and innovation; (c) for city planner, it makes it easier to create a large-scale, visible network; (d) for developer, it reduces the development costs since software that provides additional functionality would only need to be developed once.
3) Flexible payment system that supports both membership (in apps registration) and non-membership via payment kiosk.  The charger is Octopus type-test approved and can support other payment gateway, e.g. Fast Payment Service, through integration.  It’s future proof and allows the site operators, including HKSAR Gov’t, to recoup the cost of the charging services, esp in future when more EVs will come into the market.  Payment in public car park will be inevitable but become acceptable.
4) Mobile Apps supports added features such as location search, charger status monitoring, remote charger reservation, in-apps payment, QR Code scanning, order status monitoring and etc.   It makes charging smart and hassle-free, reduces the range anxiety of driver and facilitates the achievement of smart mobility of HKSAR Gov’t smart city development project.
5) ""Snapcharge"" Control and Management Platform allows user management, order management, payment transaction management, power consumption (kw/Amp/Volts) recording and analysis, charger/charging station monitoring and etc. It enables real-time monitoring of the charger and operation status for better after-sales management.  The operator can generate report for analyzing the performance for better planning.
6) Load Management Controller maximizes the availability of charger by different algorithms, e.g. even distribution, queue, dynamic, which is particular suitable for old/existing building where power grid is always not sufficient to serve power input needs of all chargers in the same car parking space.  It facilities the charger installation and adoption of more electric vehicle which is more environmental friendly since it has tail pipe to emit air polluted gas.

S-0083,Smart Pharma Packaging,智能藥品包裝,NFC Touch Limited,NFC Touch Limited,"A growing number of pharma companies are discovering the power of putting smart NFC tags on or into their product packages, as part of a label, a closure, or the container itself. Smart NFC tags can deliver several benefits. They give each product a unique identity, and support additional security features and functionalities, so each item easier to authenticate and trace. NFC tags also provide a direct link to the cloud, so products can join the pharmaceutical Internet of Things (IoT). By tapping the product package with an NFC-enabled smartphone, people can use the smart, IoT-connected NFC tag to access everything from authenticity checks to dosing information, diagnostic tools, and supply chain details.

There are three reasons why NFC tagging is an ideal choice for smart pharma applications. First, NFC is designed for secure ID applications, since each NFC tag carries a unique ID and can incorporate proven security features, including cryptographic algorithms, that safeguard data. Second, NFC offers data storage for on-product data, from a simple web link to a tamper-evident or ambient-temperature status, for quick, efficient interactions. And third, NFC connects to off-product information, providing access to large amounts of cloud-based data, such as detailed product information,  contextual rules for targeted messaging, historic tracking or an online authentication service. The result is a secure approach to digitalization for just about any pharma product.","City Management

","Data Analytics

","The Benefits of Smart, NFC-driven Solutions

The features and functionalities described above – secure ID, on-product data, and off-product data – combine to yield a wide range of capabilities that deliver a variety of benefits, including increased patient safety, higher quality assurance, greater consumer/patient engagement, and more effective messaging and analytics.

1) Anti-Counterfeiting and Channel Traceability:
By helping to ensure patient safety, combat fraud, and increase traceability, NFC smart tags and labels help protect brands and increase consumer confidence.Inspectors and consumers can securely verify that a product is genuine. Verification can happen in near real time, anywhere in the world, by simply tapping an NFC-enabled smartphone to the product package.The need to combat counterfeit drugs is critical. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently reported that 8 to 15% of drugs sold globally are fake or substandard. Developing countries are more affected than developed countries. Not only do fake medicines impact pharma revenues, they pose a health risk, since they can contain incorrect doses, wrong ingredients, or no active ingredients at all.For channel traceability, and to help identify sales outside authorized markets, NFC tags can be assigned to specific distributors and locations. The ability to authenticate and trace products within the supply chain, using location awareness and cloud-based monitoring, also makes it easier for pharma companies to meet regulatory requirements and protect the last mile to the consumer. By identifying clusters of counterfeits, tampering episodes, or diverted products, pharma companies can take corrective actions sooner.
 

2) Anti-Tampering and other Product Integrity Assurance:
An increasing number of medication – as many as one-third of all new FDA approval in the U.S. – are heat sensitive, which means improper storage and transit issues can impact quality and reduce effectiveness. Regulations for temperature control cover the points between the pharma company and the pharmacy or hospital, but not the last mile to the patient. Smart NFC labels can be equipped with temperature sensors and data loggers that monitor ambient temperature changes at any time and report whether a product has been handled correctly, even once it’s left the supply chain and is in the patient’s hands. The pharma company can trace when and where any problems occur, for quick remediation, and patients can be certain of a drug’s quality and effectiveness.Tamper evidence, which indicates if a product has been opened or interfered with prior to sale, is another feature that can reassure patients. Tamper evidence can remove doubts about whether a product has been diluted, refilled, or otherwise substituted from the original, for increased consumer-patient confidence.
 

3) Consumer/Patient Engagement:
The increased use of apps, wearables, and sensors is evidence that patients want to be more engaged in their own care, want to play a more active role in managing their well-being, and want to know more about their medications. Deloitte reports that there are over 260,000 health apps in use worldwide and that 70% of patient groups use at least one app to manage their condition – making it clear that a mobile ecosystem has developed within healthcare.On-demand product information, such as ingredients, origin, expiration date, or intended use, along with interactions with smartphone apps, such as medication management tools, diaries, or alarms, and connection to doctors and social patient networks, give consumers new ways to become more engaged. Smart NFC labels and packages can help patients stick to their treatment plans, since the technology lets pharma companies communicate key information, such as dosage and usage information, directly to patients via their smartphones.WHO estimates that more than half of patients with chronic diseases fail to adhere to their prescribed therapy. Smart NFC packages can be configured to sense when a pill is taken out of a blister package and then log date and time of the action. This feature, when used with an NFC phone and an app, can generate reminders to take a pill and/or check proper dosage. When combined with cloud connectivity, it can enable treatment monitoring and advice by a physician. Helping patients keep to their dosing schedules can be especially useful with the treatment of chronic illnesses, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and other conditions that need ongoing care.Smart NFC packages also give patients a way to interact with pharma companies, in support of the pharmacovigilance tasks related to product safety. Mobile consumer/patient engagement can help identify and prevent adverse effects associated with a given medication. Patients can use an application to report any health issues associated with use of a product, and pharmaceutical companies can inform their app users if a product is recalled. These kinds of interactions also create closer relationships between pharma companies and their consumer/patient customers.
 

4) Automated Device Interaction:
Health devices, such as glocuse meters and other drug-delivery devices, can be equipped with NFC readers that communicate with NFC tagged refills, to automatically confirm origin and prevent container re-use. NFC tagged refills can make products easier to use, too. By storing configuration data, the NFC tag can automate setups, and by storing expiration dates, the NFC tag can ensure the refill is still within its recommended use period.

S-0084,NFC Product Authentication,NFC防偽解決方案,NFC Touch Limited,NFC Touch Limited,"Customs are responsible for about 70% of all seizures of counterfeit products in the world. The role of customs is especially important in protecting the Hong Kong because the vast majority of counterfeit products are imports and, after entering the market, subject to free circulation within the community. However, in anti-counterfeiting customs role is more supportive than proactive, which means that customs mostly provide help to trademark owners to protect their IPRs when this is requested.

Customs authorities fail to seize large amounts of counterfeits either because they do not know how to recognize the fakes or because the process of gathering statements from trademark owners is too time-consuming. Proper labelling, overt anti-counterfeiting technologies and training in recognizing counterfeits would, for example, assist officials in enforcing the IPRs of affected trademark owners. Furthermore, the lack of information sharing is often perceived to be one of the main obstacles in the fight against counterfeiters. Finding counterfeit products is one part of customs responsibility to control the trade. Other control objectives include finding various kinds of dangerous materials. While controlling the trade, however, customs also work to facilitate the trade in order not to disturb import and export. These two objectives conflict and thus customs always have to balance the trade-off between control and facilitation. Taking into account also the fact that the vast majority of goods that pass through customs are legal and thus should not be disturbed, it can be seen that finding counterfeit goods is not among customs' top priorities.

Fortunately, development in technology has also enabled novel countermeasures. Most notably, the emerge of radio-frequency identification technology has opened many opportunities to fight illicit trade. NFC allows for identification of tagged objects and establishes a link between the physical world and a virtual world with a mobile phone at any place and time. This so called dual existence of objects enables a number of new ways to manage the physical world, and thus NFC is being used for example to automate many supply chain processes.","Commerce and Industry

This is done with extreme privacy control where the pet owner wouldn't disclose any personal data throughout the process. The pet owner can manage and update their pet info 24/7. 

This will include an online web platform and mobile App for both iOS and Android. Hardware products will include micro-chip 2.0 or Smart Pet ID Tag using NFC (Near Field Technology).

Our Micro-chip 2.0 solution can provide breakthrough to the existing method to enhance current RFID chipping system, e.g.:

1.	Send Mobile notification to all pets owner within the community when pet lost has occurs, to allow pet community to help each other on their lost pets.
2.	No RFID reader is required to read the data on the tag, any person can use their mobile as the reader to read the NFC chip.
3.	The micro-chip system with our Mobile App would allow the founder to make direct contact with the lost pet owner without knowing any of the pet’s owner data e.g. phone number, email or name. The communication between the founder and the owner can be done within 10 second.
4.	Since pet info can be updated easily online therefore the data is more likely to be updated.",http://nfctouch.com.hk/index_c.html

As a result, ""Digital Twin"" can provide technical support for managers of various departments in the city, as follows:
In urban planning, map the physical city to the virtual environment, build a digital city, visually display, precise planning, and efficient decision-making;
In terms of traffic travel, real-time road scenes and real-time traffic information are instant and accurate, and unmanned driving is popular, which is convenient for citizens to travel and facilitates official dispatch and control;
In terms of public safety, through the ""Digital Twin"" overview layout, formulate emergency response plans to ensure the safety of citizens;
In terms of cultural tourism, digitize historical cultural relics and historical sites to protect and inherit historical memories and provide fresh visual experiences.

However, the realization of ""Digital Twin"" must be based on massive scale of 3D model data, and the focus is on the establishment of city-level high-precision 3D models. The breakthrough of 5G makes data transmission no longer an obstacle, but the loading, editing and application of massive 3D model data is still a unified problem in the industry. The various professional software tools used in the above-mentioned industries that rely on 3D models must be run on workstations or mainframes to load 3D models above the GB level. However, Euclideon's patented unlimited detail loading technology can load TB/PB (1TB=1024GB, 1PB=1024TB) level 3D model data in a second on an ordinary computer, and can be combined with most of the current professional 3D model processing software and application tools , Greatly improve work efficiency and visual effects.

The system can be applied to multiple government departments to realize the transformation and upgrading of urban planning, transportation, public safety, cultural tourism and other fields. In view of the different sources of existing 3D models of various government departments, incompatibility, large scale, lack of details, and difficulties in display, Euclideon integrates the 3D model data of the entire city, accesses IoT information, and builds a ""Digital Twin""; at the same time, it uses Euclideon holography Tables, holographic rooms, and Vault customized clients to display ultra-high-precision real-world 3D models, compatible with existing multi-party 3D model professional software tools, and add humanized interactive modules to improve work quality and efficiency.

User requirements: As the largest BIM model owner in Hong Kong, the goal is to integrate 3D model data from multiple sources, load TB or even PB level 3D model data in a second on ordinary office computers, and add humanized interaction so that different users can Intuitive experience, and finally realize the real ""smart airport"" in order to maintain the global leading position.

Technical solution: The Euclideon Vault platform integrates 3D models of multiple data sources for the airport, covering the surrounding facilities of the airport and aircraft models. The huge amount of 3D model data is no longer a problem. Euclideon's patented infinite detail loading technology can instantly load the entire airport model and access IoT information. You can also view the flight status and detailed information of the aircraft at different time periods on the screen of Euclideon's unique holographic table and other devices. The highly user-friendly interactive design provides a precise and meticulous experience to help users complete their work with higher quality and efficiency.

Cost and benefit: The computer's graphics card, video memory, CPU, hard disk speed, and memory will greatly affect the rendering speed of the 3D model. The original model of Hong Kong International Airport has about 65 million polygons. The 3D model rendering of tens of millions of polygons can only be rendered at one time by large workstations with a price of more than 300,000 Hong Kong dollars, but it still cannot be displayed as a whole. However, Euclideon’s self-developed Vault software only charges 600USD (equivalent to 4,600HKD) per year.

It’s a top priority among public sector CIOs. No matter what your department — defense, agriculture, health and human services, education, homeland security, tax and revenue management — establishing a data-centric culture is no longer optional.

Analysts at federal, state, and local government levels are all faced not just with a torrent of data, but with data silo proliferation. Legacy sources aren’t going away, and they’re joined by new cloud or Big Data apps stemming from IT modernization efforts. All must be tapped into, blended, and enriched to answer an almost daily series of new questions arising from a changing policy and budget landscape.

","In government–whether local or federal–the pressure to provide faster insights on your agency’s programs rests squarely on your team’s shoulders. Although we live and work in a world with an overabundance of data, quick access to information and insights can be impossible if you struggle with a lack of resources, budget, and legacy systems.

Below, three common data challenges in government are addressed with use cases in public services and the benefits attained with Alteryx.

LIMITED BUDGETS AND RESOURCES
Public sector organizations are often lean operations, and both monetary and headcount resources are precious. There’s no shortage of data, but a lack of resources makes the ability to access and combine data from various sources, departments, agencies, and third parties a constant challenge. Highly trained data scientists who can perform advanced analyses are often unaffordable for public sector—which means government organizations must empower analysts with the tools to do more.

When John Matyasovsky Jr., a Database Manager and Systems Analyst for the Fifth Judicial District of Pennsylvania, was introduced to the modern self-service analytics platform Alteryx, the positive effect of the platform was immediate. With a two-week free trial, John was able to create an XML parsing process that normally would’ve taken months to build. “It was estimated that the free trial alone paid for the license investment,” he said
 
THE STATUS QUO
Nothing is more damaging to innovation than “the way we’ve always done things.” Whether the status quo is driven by mindset or legacy systems, government agencies that can streamline and automate report generation and analysis will not only be more effective, they’ll also liberate analysts to spend more time delivering unique insights instead of chasing their tails. 

Because of built-in legacy systems, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USTPO)was forced to use legacy tools like COBOL programming. Antiquated systems like COBOL are slow-moving and cumbersome, negatively impacting in the office’s ability to provide timely analysis. The department needed a system of operating and performing analytics that could accommodate, support, and respond to internal stakeholder needs as they evolve. In other words, they needed to shift from static, ancient systems to a flexible, modern approach. 

With Alteryx, analysts within the Trademarks office can easily extract data using business-friendly intelligence and analytic tools to manage both routine and ad hoc requests, like trademark application filing, prosecution, examination, registration, post-registration processes, and reporting. 

“No one is more qualified to work with our data set than us,” said James Nosal, Program Analyst. “Data that used to be manually manipulated within Microsoft Excel in hours or days, is now blended, in seconds, with Alteryx.” The Trademarks office also uses Alteryx as an ETL tool to extract data on a nightly schedule. Data goes from a legacy transactional system and is automatically loaded into an optimized data model designed specifically to support analytical efforts.

(https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alteryx-Use-Cases/Data-Analytics-Federal-Agency-and-the-Thirty-Year-Old-Legacy/ta-p/162629)

ON-TIME ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS
A major issue with analytics is reporting lag—by the time you understand what’s happened, everything has changed, and the data is no longer relevant. Increasing the speed, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of data analysis is critical to driving your agency’s future.

Following Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) needed to rapidly assess damage to a minimum of 130,000 structures in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Extremely challenging conditions like blocked roadways and landslides made traditional field assessments slow and difficult. Additionally, the assessment had to include the effects of combined wind and flood damage from two distinct, but consecutive hurricanes. After the storm, teams visited 600+ structures and took detailed measurements to serve as training data for a damage model; and analytic teams built an Alteryx workflow blending over a dozen GIS and tabular data sets to serve as predictive variables. The model was updated and revised daily to improve the quality of the prediction. 

This project helped over 100,000 people get on the road to recovery more quickly. It cleared a significant hurtle for them as far as rebuilding their structures and it gave the communities information that they really needed to start reconstruction. They evaluated about 146,000 structures, of which about 30,000 of needed an on-the-ground inspection. The net result was that only about 21% of the total needed further inspection, which saved tens of millions of dollars in the response effort. It also saved years in terms of the amount of time that it will take to recover in some of those communities. It was all made possible because of what they were able to do with Alteryx.

S-0119,Ziizau - Optimization of route design,,Cyberlogic Bt.,,"Ziizau is a mobile application that optimizes route design, finds the shortest travel route.

The application provides the user an interactive interface for route planning by a detailed map view. Routes are defined by selecting locations on the map, they are called waypoints. The waypoints can be added manually or automatically by importing them from a data file. One of the waypoints is designated as the starting location for the route.

Route optimization is based on finding the shortest path regarding the travel distance that connects all the waypoints. The optimization process is done in seconds or less and it takes into account natural obstacles (for example rivers or islands). The result is drawn on the map by connected waypoints as the shortest route. Besides the optimized route, more information is available like the route length, duration or the actual coordinates of the route waypoints.

Ziizau application can be easily modified to meet the required service needs:
- The input of the route information can be automated. Data can be taken from an already existing database or imported from mobile systems. GPS data can be converted into route waypoints.
- Analytics can be applied on the database in order to label waypoints with meta data that helps the optimization process to make more accurate decisions.
- Waypoints can be defined by manual location selection, address search or lat/lon coordinate input.
- Additional information can be added to each waypoint (for example extra time spent at the location) and it will be taken into account at the optimization process.
- Meta data / labels can be attached to waypoints that will serve as visualization aids, they can be shown on the map view.
- The route optimization process can be adjusted for the shortest travel distance or for the fastest travel time, also the maximum number of optimizable waypoints can be increased.
- Waypoints along with their optimized routes can be stored into the system, organized into different categories. The stored data / results can be quickly loaded by selections from lists.
- Data export can be added for the selected or all the optimized routes and their relevant information.
- Integration with other systems through web service calls and / or moving the system into cloud.","Commerce and Industry

","The Ziizau application can be useful in many scenarios. Primary application can be route optimization for mail delivery in the city. It can help find the shortest routes including travel distance or fastest delivery time. Complete route planning process can be automated and enhanced with self-learning capabilities.

In case there is an already existing database with location and other meta data, by using various methods, predictions can be made and new information can be produced that helps the optimization process. Optimization can be more accurate in cases, when:
- Locations are labeled with weights for different time frames
- Locations have adjusted or variable time or travel distance data
- Locations can be enabled / disabled
- Location groups can be created to ease rule applications on them
- Measured data about optimized routes can be used as feedback for future re-optimizations

Areas of possible usage, scenarios that can benefit from route optimization:
- Mail / goods delivery

By installing our 4G/LTE equipped mobility mesh access points, a large-scale Mesh Wi-Fi network can be easily built in outdoor area and enables all associated Wi-Fi clients connecting to network/internet by both wired and 4G/LTE access.  Rooted at our wireless research on distributed channel and fast routing optimization, instant and dynamic path changing achieves many folds improvement in Wi-Fi coverage while maintaining high throughput under unpredictable and harsh wireless environment.  Thanks to the three-radios design, throughput degrade is much minimized during multiple hopping.  Battery powered outdoor mesh access points with built-in antennas can easily extend the Wi-Fi coverage anytime to extra location where Wi-Fi connections is requested. In addition to basic configuration and monitoring features, other advanced ones like Wi-Fi coverage site survey, social login, captive portal, landing page and AI channel optimization are also provided in our enterprise grade cloud management server.  4G mesh Wi-Fi access points help in building up Wi-Fi network in area where optic fiber cabling is costly or difficult. This solution can be applied in free Wi-Fi hotspot at smart lamppost in Hong Kong so as to reduce the investment cost and simplify the installation. 

2.	Multi-profiles 4G/Wi-Fi Ethernet adapter:
At large outdoor operating area like container ports and landfill sites where 4G cellular signal is only partly covered, our unique multi-profiles 4G/Wi-Fi Ethernet adapter allows vehicular devices to use both Wi-Fi and 4G/LTE for data communication such as real-time two-way messages communication or GPS location reporting. Client devices can seamless shift between Wi-Fi and 4G/LTE connection for reliable communication when 4G/LTE is too weak to connect. The Wi-Fi coverage can be provided by using 4G/LTE mesh Wi-Fi access points. Temporary stations with high gain LTE antenna can be built in location where LTE signal is good and provide Wi-Fi signal for area where LTE signal cannot reach. This solution can be applied for client devices that need real time data communication in remote areas of Hong Kong that 4G/LTE coverage is marginal such as landfill sites and new development zones.

Dynatrace is the only performance monitoring solution that is designed to automatically detect and analyze an IoT topology without any manual configuration. It delivers full operational insights into the complex ecosystem of technology: sensors, devices, gateways, networks, cloud environments, private data centers and applications. The AI-powered engine allows you to:
- Manage IoT complexity and scale with prioritized actionable alerts and insights
- Understand the impact and resolve issues affecting business-critical systems quickly and proactively, in real-time
- Ingest and understand health of diverse data sources from a wide variety of edge devices, simple sensors, to full blown servers and everything in between to understand performance, and create improvements in your IoT environment

AI-powered, full stack Dynatrace monitors not just the behavior of the back-end cloud platform, but also enables monitoring on the devices themselves.

Dynatrace does not monitor individual sensors - the minimum requirement for monitoring is that it can run its own code and perform actions and network transactions. However, communication between the sensor and the device could be an action which is monitored, e.g. activities, health, records timing, latencies, and errors to feed these metrics into the overall context of the application.

Dynatrace also does not capture the payload from a sensor; it is not a big data solution or a visualization tool for sensor data. Dynatrace is the solution for monitoring the entire ecosystem because proper IoT monitoring includes not just the device, but also IoT back-end applications and integration into business processes.","Broadcasting

This manages costs and controls energy flow based on need. Dynatrace determines if devices are working, and if not, what is the problem, where is it occurring, and who should repair it.

2. Smart metering - Meters reduce operational costs and collect information about energy consumption, so that heating decisions can be based on fluctuating energy costs to optimize expenses. For example, Dynatrace reduces issues like energy theft by monitoring communication and connection issues and detecting and flagging anomalies.

3. Manufacturing operations - Sensor data is pre-processed on devices controlling the manufacturing process before being sent back for evaluation; improvements via software updates on devices can be delivered regularly. Dynatrace provides actionable data on deployment issues that minimize bad code and associated time and costs.

4. Healthcare - Sensitive healthcare equipment can be monitored so that critical devices are updated regularly with minimal effort. Dynatrace helps find deployment and performance issues at the exact code level, lowering risk, and saving time and costs.

5. Off-site oil and gas - Monitors pipelines which can be thousands of miles long; gathers and processes data from sensors which send notifications when anomalies occur – such as leaks or theft of energy. Dynatrace identifies if device is sending and receiving data, and flags the location of issues.

6. Fleet Management - Anomalies trigger alarms and the collected data can be sent from vehicles to smart-panic emergency systems to avoid accidents. If there is an emergency the vehicle can be remotely disabled. Dynatrace ensures that devices are sending data on time and that back-end services are running error-free to make the best emergency decisions.

7. Agriculture - Many use cases, including knowing how much is remaining in a fodder container, or understanding details about the watering level of every single corner in the field. This helps to identify problems like water adjustments or empty containers to minimize risks to crops and livestock. Dynatrace maps all connections and devices and reports on performance, identifying issues and locations of variances.

8. Retail - Consumers get customized offers on their mobile devices for an engaging in-store-experience, sold items can be equipped with sensors to improve customer service. If a problem occurs, a service team can be automatically notified to proactively help the customer. Dynatrace provides visibility at key connection points and identifies whether the customer is having a good or bad experience for faster remediation and continuous improvement.

9. Connected home - Used in a variety of ways, for example heating, lights, oven, and alarm systems. All of these can be monitored for proper function and performance. Dynatrace assures connections are error free, and if not, identifies the problem and its root cause.

10. Wearables - As an example, a smart watch may capture biometric readings and use this medical data to improve patient treatment, prevent illness or even detect emergencies and notify the proper authorities. Data could also connect with health insurance providers to access discounts for exercising. Dynatrace can help to show if the connections are working, and if issues occur, locate problem points down to the OS and code level for faster repair or resolution.",www.udshk.com
S-0154,Cisco Stealthwatch Encrypted Traffic Analytics,,UDS Data Systems Limited,,"Traditional flow monitoring provides a high-level view of network communications by reporting the addresses, ports, and byte and packet counts of a flow. In addition, intraflow metadata, or information about events that occur inside of a flow, can be collected, stored, and analyzed within a flow monitoring framework. This data is especially valuable when traffic is encrypted, because deep-packet inspection is no longer viable. This enhanced intraflow metadata is derived by using new types of data elements or telemetry that are independent of protocol details, such as the lengths and arrival times of messages within a flow. These data elements have the attractive property of applying equally well to both encrypted and unencrypted flows. Using these data elements or enhanced intraflow telemetry to identify malware communication in encrypted traffic means Cisco® Encrypted Traffic Analytics can maintain the integrity of the encrypted flow without the need for bulk decryption.

Encrypted Traffic Analytics focuses on identifying malware communications in encrypted traffic through passive monitoring, the extraction of relevant data elements, and a combination of behavioral modeling and machine learning with cloud-based global visibility.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that provides privacy for applications. TLS is usually implemented on top of common protocols such as HTTP for web browsing or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for email. HTTPS is the use of TLS over HTTP. This is the most popular way of securing communication between a web server and client and is supported by most major web servers. Encrypted Traffic Analytics extracts four main data elements: The initial data packet, the sequence of packet lengths and times, the byte distribution, and TLS-specific features. Cisco’s unique Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) architecture provides the ability to extract these data elements without slowing down the data network.","Broadcasting

","1. Follow up close contacts of the confirmed patient:
This technology is a mobile APP service that can record the people who have been in close contact with the user within 28 days (provided that both parties need to use the APP service). The user needs to install the company’s APP (or use other APP applications that integrate the SDK of this service) and turn on the Bluetooth of the mobile phone. When the user stands about two meters away and is in contact for several minutes, the APP service will exchange data via Bluetooth Record information about contacts. This means that if a user is diagnosed with an illness, he can track people who have had close contact with him through the record of this function, even if the user cannot accurately recall his whereabouts.
The service can be put into use immediately, and in the server zero user privacy technology of the company's independent intellectual property rights, any product and service of the company will not involve users' private information. If this function is used by everyone, combined with another identity authentication technology of our company (excluding all identity forgery and fraudulent use), it will be able to accurately track every person who has been in contact with the patient, effectively control the spread of the epidemic, and help companies To provide assistance for the resumption of work and production.

2. Identity authentication technology based on social relations:
Current identity authentication methods cannot simply and effectively eliminate fraudulent use of identity (factors such as authentication cost, high threshold, etc.). For example, during the epidemic, the community's registration of visitors, registration in public places, etc., are difficult to prevent fraud. The hidden dangers of using identity registration; at the same time, there is a lack of identity authentication methods for foreigners.
The identity authentication technology of the company’s independent intellectual property rights is different from the verification mechanism of ""personal identification combined with one"" because passwords, short messages, faces, and ID cards can all be stolen or voluntarily used for fraud. However, it cannot be used by others. Therefore, in this social relationship-based identity authentication, each user has only one identity, there is no multiple identity, and only the person can log in and cannot be fraudulently used. At the same time, social relations (identifying acquaintances) have no cognitive threshold for people of almost any age and country.
This identity authentication technology can be applied to the three major difficulties in epidemic prevention and control, such as community entry and exit management, entry and exit management of epidemic areas, home isolation management, etc., through a simple and effective identity authentication method, completely exclude visitors from fraudulent use in the community Identity security risks, effective registration of the whereabouts of immigrants (including foreigners), and an effective monitoring method for home self-isolation.

How to use the above services:
1. Our company has developed an SDK with the above functions, which can be integrated and used in other APP applications. For example, in mainland China, the city public service application ""Aiguangxi APP"" in Guangxi Province is docking with our SDK. 2.

","Currently, Hong Kong’s new fiscal year plans to issue 10,000 Hong Kong dollars per person to permanent residents aged 18 or above. It is undoubtedly one of the most efficient methods to implement the payment through online banking, but this method relies heavily on the reliability of online identity verification. If there is a loophole, it will cause the hidden danger of being stolen by others and receiving subsidies by false identity.
At present, the mainstream online identity verification methods such as account password, mobile phone SMS, ID card, face and other verification have the possibility of being stolen and fraudulently used. Therefore, if the issuance is implemented through online banking, it will face how to ensure "" The current user applying for the subsidy has the same identity as the bank account holder"".
The identity verification technology with independent intellectual property rights of the company has three characteristics that can perfectly solve this difficulty, and can ensure that every verified user has only one identity; ensure that only the account holder (registrant) can log in to his account; In terms of universality, it is suitable for almost any age group and race; and combined with another independent intellectual property rights of the company's server zero user privacy technology, it can complete verification under the premise of ensuring user privacy.

implementation plan:
Integrate our company’s identity verification SDK (or call our company’s APP product) into the bank APP designated by the government to apply for subsidies. When residents use the bank’s APP to submit subsidy applications, the identity verification provided by our company will be performed. If the verification is passed, It means that the current user is the holder of the bank account and can directly issue subsidies to the bank account.

1) Why COVID-19 is spreading fast?
The biggest reason why Coronavirus is so easy to spread in the community is that infected persons have an incubation period of about 14 days, and there are no obvious surface symptoms.
Many people do not know if they have been in contact with incubators. If the use of blocking strategies such as closing schools, closing in-door gym., closing movie theater, & closing the border, it can only be solved the problem in the shorter term.
In the longer-term, it not only affects the normal life of citizens but also causes huge economic losses.
 
2) The Mathematical Model of Coronavirus Spreading
Mathematically, assuming the infection rate is 2% and the average size of people gather in the public areas is 600 people.
If the community do nothing to identify the incubators and alert them not to enter public areas, in 84 days, the total infected people can grow to 3 million.
If we can block 80% of incubators, the infected number can be reduced drastically to less than 1,000.
 
3) Our System is based on the Mathematical Model
The most effective way to implement the mathematical model is to use the smartphone registration app and also to install dedicated terminals in public places such as a library, cinema, school, and gym to record where and when the citizens have visited.
When a person is reported as virus-infected by medical authorities, the system immediately puts all persons who appear in the same place at the same time as the confirmed patient into an Alert list and transmits it to all terminals.

The traditional way might require a very powerful server and a very fast database which is very expensive and difficult to serve million class traffic. Only a fully distributed, cloud-native solution can eliminate the chance for Denial of Service due to sudden heavy traffic.
The solution’s cost is calculated per quota, in our previous experience for selling masks, for example, if there are 100,000 quota available, the pricing model would be 100,000 * (HKD0.x-HKD2.0) depending on various factors.

S-0217,nCloud Fault-Tolerant Geo-distributed Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI),,CU Coding Ltd.,CU Coding Ltd.,"To support hyper-scale storage management across multiple geographical regions, we posit that Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) should be geared towards geo-distributed deployment. A geo-distributed HCI can follow a hierarchical topology: it is composed of multiple DCs that reside in different geographical regions, in which each DC is composed of multiple nodes (or servers) for storage. Thus, a geo-distributed HCI unifies the storage space across different geographical regions to form a global-scale storage pool.

One critical deployment requirement of a geo-distributed HCI is to maintain availability and durability guarantees in the presence of failures, ranging from transient failures where data is temporarily unavailable (e.g., power loss, network disconnection, system upgrades, reboots), to permanent failures where data is permanently lost (e.g., disk crashes, sector errors). Cloud outages are common in practice. 

Storing data with redundancy is a typical fault-tolerant approach, as any lost or unavailable data can be recovered through the available redundant data. Traditional distributed storage systems use replication to provide fault tolerance. The idea is to create multiple identical copies (called replicas) for each data chunk and distribute the replicas across different nodes. However, the storage overhead of replication is significant, and poses a scalability concern with the unprecedented growth of data volume.

We present our core technology, network coding, proposed by the research team at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2000. Network coding provides a promising low-cost redundancy mechanism to achieve fault tolerance, while significantly reducing the storage overhead compared to traditional replication and achieving optimal repair performance with theoretical guarantees. It belongs to a special class of erasure coding. We first formalize the terminologies of erasure coding, and then elaborate how network coding improves the repair performance.","Infrastructure
GovCloud
","Cloud Computing
Network Coding
","High storage efficiency: nCloud leverages network coding to minimize the amount of storage redundancy compared to traditional replication, thereby saving the long-term operational costs.

High performance: nCloud mitigates the cross-DC traffic to maintain high repair performance. It also mitigates the overhead on other applications that share the cross-DC bandwidth.

High fault tolerance: nCloud achieves high fault tolerance via network coding in two aspects: (i) availability, which means that any unavailable data remains accessible through data redundancy, and (ii) durability, which means there is no data loss in the face of node or DC failures.

Security via diversity: nCloud exploits secret sharing (see our previous work CDStore [22]) to generate secure coded chunks (called shares), such that an adversary cannot recover the stored data if the number of shares is insufficient.

Software-defined storage management: nCloud provides a configurable, software-defined storage management framework to readily address the heterogeneity of storage resources and application requirements.",

With bulk updates, IT can perform a mass transfer of ownership or revocation of users’ rights on protected files, and replicate a user’s permissions to another user. These time saving bulk update features reduce the management of protected documents to just one step.

3. Protect Any File on Any Device and OS

The mobile app developed using hybrid framework is operable on both iOS and Android, that are the most commonly used operating systems of mobile device. This reduces the development cost of mobile apps significantly as only one app that can fit into two operating systems is developed, instead of developing two native apps separating for iOS and Android. 

In a product development cycle, we first collect and discuss the requirements with users, and then design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for the application. Afterwards, we start to implement the software and run sprint cycles to build and test the app. Once the development is completed, the project will be launched and move to maintenance phase. 

In addition, Gianthouse adopts a mixture of waterfall and agile approach as development methodology. Agile approach is used in software development to promote velocity and adaptability, since the benefits of such approach is that adjustments can be made along the product development cycle rather than following a strict waterfall path. One of the aims of an agile approach is to reduce the development costs and shorten the prototyping process.","Broadcasting

","This bike-sharing system provides an economical alternative to public transport for the public; this will have an impact on traffic diversion hence to mitigate traffic congestion.
This is not only an economical alternative for the public, but also an eco-friendly alternative. Bikes are electrically assisted; the power of the electric motor doesn’t exceed 250W which complies with the European standard. The electric motor assistance ends when the cyclist stops pedaling and allows each charge-up to power the system for a minimum of 7 days after the start of a trip.
These bikes are also designed to be as user-friendly as possible. Each bike is ergonomically designed to provide comfortable ride to the cyclist, as well as an electronic locker equipped that allows parking for temporary stops. Furthermore, the bikes enable parent cyclists to attach a bike baby chair.

Bike sharing will support and promote the image of Hong Kong as a green and sustainable city. Managed bike sharing systems support the reduction of carbon emission, a healthy lifestyle and tourism (many tourist like to use bike sharing systems as great alternative to explore the city and surroundings – the acceptance and utilization is quite high if the service quality is matching their expectations).

With Siemens Mobility latest IoT and AI technology, sustainability in a long run in all aspects is guaranteed, e.g. efficiency monitoring, smart data analysis for performance enhancement, fast tracking for maintenance, energy saving, smart advertising etc.

Costs: 
•	Initial installation cost depending on the selected service area.

At its core is a self-sovereign identity and health status attestation solution—people can store all information needed to access offices, transport, public spaces using a BLOK Pass app that is owned and controlled only by the user. With appropriate testing protocols in place and with information on an individual’s COVID-19 status stored on the BLOK App, the establishment of travel bubbles is made possible. The platform is easily configurable, and can be adapted to monitor a wide variety of evidence types—including anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody status or T cell immunity—to reflect the latest scientific evidence and diagnostic technologies. Symptoms can be tracked, and test results of all kinds (laboratory or rapid point-of-care PCR, antigen, antibody, etc.) can be validated, attested and stored for use in access protocols/ These can be defined and configured according to rules established by government, border controls, transport providers, entertainment and event venue providers, companies, etc.","Commerce and Industry

","As mentioned above, the BLOK Pass app can form the core of a travel bubble solution: It provides a means by which travellers can log COVID-19 test results and declare any symptoms they may be displaying, while having all this information stored securely on their devices; it communicates to relevant personnel/authorities what appropriate actions should be taken according to the travellers’ health statuses and their company’s/country’s protocols, without revealing any further information about the travellers. BLOK Pass app has also been designed to be easily integrated with existing APIs and contact-tracing solutions, meaning that cross-border compatibility is unlikely to be an issue. 

The cost of the BLOK Pass app (HK$50) is far exceeded by its potential benefits. The average overnight visitor per capita spending in 2018 was HK$6,614, and recent figures indicate that tourist arrivals in the January-August period declined by 91.9 percent YoY; the successful implementation of travel bubbles is imperative to the revival of the battered tourism sector.",www.gtech.hk
