What is digital forensics?
Electronic information today can be important clue or evidence to support crime investigation or litigation.
Digital forensics is the process of utilizing scientifically proven methods to seizure and process potential evidence data found on a digital device (such as computer, laptop, hard drive, mobile phone, memory card etc.), and interpret that data forensically, to let the digital evidence be admitted in court.
Electronic evidence may assist in the prosecution of a criminal, help in the defense of an accused person, or be of intelligence to an individual who is seeking knowledge for either personal or professional reasons.
