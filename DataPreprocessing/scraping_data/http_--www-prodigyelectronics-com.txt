Printed Circuit Board
Prodigy’s component divisions supports global customer’s to manufacture custom Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) from its manufacturing centers in China and Taiwan.
Certifications
Rigid PCB
Rigid PCBs are produced with a solid material which prevents them from twisting. Once manufactured they can no longer be modified or folded into shapes. Rigid PCBs are well-known for its high density, high reliability, designable, testability and maintainability. They are also relatively less-cost than other types of PCB, which is one of the reason rigid PCBs are widely considered when producing electronic products.
Layer Count: 1 to 64 Layers
Board Thickness: 0.25mm to 10mm
Dimensions: 1092*660mm (max.)
Line Width/ Space: 3mil/ 3mil (min.)
Drilling Diameter:
Flexible PCB
Flexible PCBs offer more options and configurations when assembling electronic circuits. They are manufactured with flexible plastic material which enables the ability to fold over edges and wrap around corners, making them become one of the most important components in today’s most advanced electronic products.
Layer Count: 6L
Dimensions: 500*650mm (max.), 10*10mm (min.)
Material: FCCL, stiffener, cover-lay
Final Cu Thickness: 1/3-1oz (iner layer base Cu), 1/3-2oz (outer layer base Cu)
Line Width/ Space: 0.075/ 0.075mm finished Cu 0.5oz inner layer, finished Cu 1oz outer layer
Finished Drilling: CNC drill: min. Ø 0.15, laser drill: min. Ø 0.1mm
Aspect Ratio: laser drill: max. 1.2:1, CNC drill: max. 15:1
Rigid-Flex PCB
Rigid-Flex PCB is the combination of rigid and flexible board technologies. This allows an application to have a more streamlined design and ability to reduce the overall board size and package weight.
Layer Count: 1 to 64 Layers
Board Thickness: 0.25mm to 10mm
Dimensions: 1092*660mm (max.)
Line Width/ Space: 3mil/ 3mil (min.)
Drilling Diameter:
HDI PCB
HDI technology enables a PCB to have higher wiring density, which greatly enhances its electrical performance and optimizes overall package weight and dimension of an equipment.
Layer Count: 48L (4+N+4)
Board Thickness: 0.3mm to 8mm (min. to max.)
Dimensions: 250*330mm (max.)
Line Width/ Space: 3
Heavy Copper PCB
Heavy Copper circuit boards are the core components of household appliances, high-tech products, medical or military equipment, due to the fact of the high durability, good heat dissipating and transferring capabilities.
Layer Count: 1 to 64 Layers
Board Thickness: 0.25mm to 10mm
Dimensions: 1092*660mm (max.)
Line Width/ Space: 3mil/ 3mil (min.)
Drilling Diameter:
Metal Clad PCB
Metal clad PCB is a type of circuit board that consists of metal laminate and electrically insulated layer. Therefore it adds up extra strength and endurance to the product, best for applications with high temperature and pressure involved.
Layer Count: 1 to 64 Layers
Board Thickness: 0.25mm to 10mm
Dimensions: 1092*660mm (max.)

Can I leave isolated tracks on the surface of the board? Cyrus Kwok 2020-06-03T16:15:50+08:00
This is a most unwise procedure. These isolated tracks will become over plated and will be difficult to cover with solder mask. If the design needs an isolated track then it is advisable to cross hatch the unpopulated area.
Do via holes need pads on the outer layers? Cyrus Kwok 2020-06-03T16:15:41+08:00
What is SMOBC? Cyrus Kwok 2020-06-03T16:09:57+08:00
Simply stated, it stands for Solder Mask Over Bare Copper. Traditional solder mask coatings are done over a reflowed tin/lead finish. Although the tin/lead finish is desirable for the pads for better solderability, this tin/lead coating is not necessary for the rest of the circuitry if it is protected by solder mask. The real reason for developing this process was to prevent the wrinkling effect of the tin/lead trapped under the solder mask when it is again reflowed during the assembly operation when the components are soldered with a wave solder machine.
Why was my quote so much higher or lower than it was last time? Cyrus Kwok 2020-06-03T16:10:07+08:00
Two possible reasons are this would be that you either requested a different quantity or a different delivery. Allowing for nominal increases for the rising prices of material and labor, the price you are quoted should be consistent with previous quotes or orders as long as the quantities and deliveries remain the same. Circuit boards are custom manufactured and the price is very dependent on the quantity being manufactured and the time allowed. Since we have to perform as many steps in the manufacturing process for 1 board as we do for 1000 boards, efficiency dictates that the more product that we can run through the numerous processes required, the more time we save per board. That time saved results in better pricing for larger quantities.
What types of bare board fabrication are you best suited for? Cyrus Kwok 2020-06-02T13:46:52+08:00
