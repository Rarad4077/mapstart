SmartObjectâ€™s name originates from our initial technology focus, smart objects and smart devices in areas of Internet of Things, Physical Computing and Ubiquitous Computing; while we have expanded the meaning as effectively linking our clients to their suppliers, partners and customers through our services and solutions, no matter they are SME or enterprise.
Our mission is to help companies reach their active buyers and profit from their investment. SmartObject helps companies do just that by converting client goals and objectives into tangible results. We do it with sound Internet of Things advice and Interaction Design to boost efficiency and increase market share. We understand that each client's industry and business model is unique, and that is why we are not bound to one magic bullet solution. Our size and independence enables us to adapt our techniques to fit your needs.

In short, SmartObject fills the conceptualization, design, product and solution development gaps in your business. We work purposefully, simply aspiring to the highest quality in everything what we do. We never launch a new project if we are not sure our client gets the best solution possible.
We sell only unique innovation and interactive solutions. Unique strategy. Unique design. Unique technical implementations. Each of our projects is unique, because it is our passion that fuels our desire to be the best.
