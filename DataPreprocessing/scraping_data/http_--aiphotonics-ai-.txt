Alphotonics strives to create revolutionary 3D solutions by applying artificial intelligence technologies. We combine proprietary approaches on 3D photography and LiDAR scanning to bring high degree of reality to virtual environment. With the collected point cloud data, which is further proceeded using our Al systems, we aim to increase the productivity of Architecture, Engineering and Construction industries.
Al + Photonics
Our 3D LiDAR solution can be tailored to the specific        needs of our clients for smart city applications. With our        wide range expertise in photonics, we can offer solution-oriented consulting, development, production, and        service.
Who are we?
We are a Hong Kong based Al company, with expertise        in computer vision, deep learning and system engineering in both hardware and software implementation. We        provide solutions such as 3D AR vision, indoor navigation and computer vision on point clouds.
 Customized 3D scanner to evaluate the interior spaces for  meeting construction specifications through the use of Al technologies.
Handy, Accurate, User-Friendly
No matter what your professional field is,                                                from AEC to tourism, you may want to keep                                                a record of the measurements of your work,                                                or take a 3D snapshot of your vicinity.
Our 3D scanners make use of point cloud                                                technology, to provide you with a 3D documentation with distance measurements up                                                to 100m.
