The RTLS platform helps monitors the real-time {location}, interactions and status of   {people} and {things} in the physical world to make the most complex  processes visible and controllable.​
High precision real-time location solution (RTLS) is fully sensor agnostic – integrating location-sensing technology including Ultra-Wide Band (UWB), Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE), RFID and Zigbee Networks.
The technologies offers 30 cm accuracy between three directional tracking (x, y, z) within 100 meters range
Components
The tags are mobile transceiver units.
Due to their compact dimensions and various mounting options the tags can be easily attached to moving objects. 
 
required following system rules. Installed in tracking environment the stations collect localization data to have exact information about objects of interest.
The position of a device is computed by the device itself which simply analyzes the UWB synchronization and Zigbee signals used by the location network.
