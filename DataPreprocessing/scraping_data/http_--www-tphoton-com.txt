Trinity Photonics was founded in 2007 by a group of enthusiastic people specialized in the fields of optical communication and photonic technology.  With years of experience in research and development of next generation networks and systems, the company has launched a series of patented solution based on the state-of-the-art Bus Passive Optical Network (BusPON) for delivering broadband and seamless multi-service signals to multiple users. The mission of the company is "Realization of Next Generation Networks for Today".
The company has a strong vision of providing one-stop reliable solution to achieve the goal of Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH), Fiber-to-the-Curb (FTTC) and Fiber-to-the-Building (FTTB) globally for Metro and Access networks.  The BusPON technology is the evolution of the existing EPON and GPON solutions, which is a WDM-PON designed for deployment in both dense urban cities with high-rise buildings and rural areas with complicated geographical situations.  The long reach capability of BusPON (range of 50km) allows the system to cater for merging Metro and Access networks in one network.  Not only the bandwidth delivered by BusPON is an order of magnitude better than recent PONs systems, but it is also the first PON system that demonstrates intelligent resilience in single fiber architecture.  The value of Trinity Photonics is to deliver worldclass quality solutions with asian prices and becomes "Your Partner for the Next Generation Network" .
