Frequently Asked Questions
What is customer relationship management (CRM)?
Customer relationship management (CRM) refers for the way in which a company interacts with its customers and clients. For example, many companies these days use loyalty apps to interact with their customers. Check out how we implemented the customer loyalty app for Hong Kong Express Airways .
What are CRM apps?
CRM apps can be as simple as a dedicated membership space for your customers, rewarding their loyalty and giving them benefits. CRM loyalty apps are useful as they identify repeat and loyal customers and provide a valuable pool of customers for you to market towards.
How important are CRM apps for customer loyalty?
CRM apps are not the only way to generate customer loyalty, however they are an asset for modern businesses. By carefully allocating your budget on current customers through a CRM app, you can foster their loyalty through rewards and privileges.
These same rewards are generated and offered by our own AI engines. They analyse customer behaviour and interactions to work out what offers and rewards will be most enticing for them. It is a hands-free way of pleasing your current customers and maintaining a good relationship with your current customers.
Why should I allocate budget to CRM rather than acquiring new customers?
Acquiring new customers can be costly. But statistics have shown that providing incentive towards your existing customers is a far better return on your investment.
What are the benefits of a CRM loyalty app platform?
Developing a CRM loyalty app can greatly reduce your marketing costs, as well as providing a communication loop through user generated content that allows your company to have increased relevance to its customers.
How can I design my own CRM loyalty app platform?
Motherapp can help you implement your own app tailored to your specific needs. Take a look at some of our case studies with companies such as Lane Crawford and see how we provided specialised solutions to their individual situations. You can also send us a service enquiry to find out how to make a CRM app to suit your business.

HK Express - Agile Development for reward-U Customer Loyalty Platform - Motherapp
Enhance customer engagement and loyalty with mobile app
#agiledevelopment #aillia #customerengagementfaq #journeyanalytics #marketingautomation #membershipplatform #o2oloyalty #softwaredevelopment
Background
reward-U is a lifestyle customer loyalty app solution launched in 2016 as the dedicated loyalty arm of HK Express – Hong Kong’s low-fare airline. It has since expanded to include various lifestyle, dining, travel and many other services in its customer loyalty program offering.
reward-U as a customer engagement app, stands out from the pack with its straightforward earn-and-redeem system, open point-sharing and unconventional transparency in its redemption approach. Though the multi-faceted loyalty program only started in mid-2016, it has grown exponentially with over 1 million members to date.
Step 2
Business Challenge
After customer segmentation and customer analysis, it is found that with majority of their members in the 23 – 35 age group, and a partner library with the hottest brands- a mobile presence was the missing key to propel them forward as the top of mind association in a consumer purchase lifecycle.
Other than considering the needs of its members, partner alliance and integration are also key factors of consideration. Thus, the end goal of the customer engagement mobile app has to result in an ecosystem where multiple functions can be performed by the user, and multi-partner promotions easily accessed on the platform itself.
To facilitate the ever-changing pace of consumer lifestyle patterns and preferences and an ever-growing partner portfolio, a degree of flexibility was also needed for changes to be easily implemented without affecting the whole user experience.
Step 3
The Solution
With the complexity of multi-partner integration, the scrum methodology was employed by the customer loyalty app development team so that testing could be done in the early phases, and changes if any, made ahead of implementation. Sequential addition also allowed us to consider the end-user’s experience at each design phase before moving on to the next, allowing for flexibility and saving much time on unnecessary efforts.
To enhance member engagement with the app and limit exit-rate, points collection and redemption with external partners need only require one-click access and is processed within the app itself.
This seamless earn-and-redeem point system is optimised to be shared with friends and family in a “reward-U crew” which creates a sense of community and belonging- further enhancing the loyalty mindshare. Functions on the app allow easy viewing of crew activity to keep members engaged.
Responsive visuals, personalisation, and simplistic templates are amongst the details that complement reward-U’s competitive advantage of process transparency and a straightforward point system in the customer loyalty app.
Step 4
The Results
Within 2 weeks of app launch, the mobile app dominated iOS and Android App Stores in the top 10 download list. More than 30% of reward-U members are now active users of the loyalty mobile app.
On-time delivery: Scrum methodology and agile project delivery by the customer loyalty app development team has ensured an impressive launch timeline of within 6 months for the mobile app and 9 months for the website.
Multi-level integration: Cross-industry partner integration successfully implemented along with major backend systems such as email databases and more. Members do not need to leave the app to complete redemption transactions or earn points from partners.
Project Accuracy with Minimal Last-minute Changes Timely and regular testing minimised last-minute changes and improved communication with client as progress can be effectively seen at each step.
Partners Gained As a Result: reward-U loyalty app was able to gain more partners and better customer engagement as a result of the app success and its ease-of-use and implementation.
Straightforward, UX-focused design: Fuss-free point calculation, collection, redemption and community sharing has directly and indirectly fortified reward-U’s loyalty app foundation. Visuals and backend systems seamlessly supports a one-stop loyalty product with great enhancement flexibility and potential.

Lane Crawford – UX Consulting and Agile Development for Mobile eCommerce Solution
A Greater China Luxury Retailer
#agiledevelopment #customerengagementfaq #digitalconsulting #journeyanalytics #marketingautomation #membershipplatform #Prescriptiveanalytics #uxdesign
Background
A retail company with specialty stores selling designer label luxury goods in Hong Kong and China, the client is one of the largest departmental stores in Hong Kong.
With the launch of its digital flagship in 2011, the client became the first omni-channel fashion retailer in Hong Kong and in Greater China, continuing to enhance its range of specialised services online that echo the actual physical retail experience. This includes eCommerce mobile app for online retail and customer engagement.
Step 2
Business Challenge
As a digital retail leader, the client wanted to replicate the in-store experience online in their eCommerce website and app, and make it simpler for members and users alike to search for what they want while shopping online. Due to fast changing user preference, it should also be relatively simple to make changes on the eCommerce app.
To cater to the different needs of the market, they wanted to create an online shopping experience that is tailored and personalised to each individual, so that the eCommerce mobile app will be useful to each one.
Step 3
The Solution
Our user experience (UX) consulting services was employed, where we set out to understand from the user’s point of view, what improvements they look for in the new online shopping platform, and what they expect to see on the mobile app. Stakeholder interviews were also conducted with the internal staff, management and shoppers alike.
With the data collected from user interviews, we tailored the app to suit the needs and wants of the audience for a mobile retail and customer engagement solution that is truly made for them. These user feedback were also ranked in importance to allow our retail app development project team better clarity to prioritise accordingly with our scrum project methodology.
Step 4
The Results
On- time delivery due to scrum methodology implemented by our eCommerce app development team.
The flexibility of API deployment and adaptations has led to increased opportunities for the client to do multi cross-industry partnerships.
The mobile solutions are loved by customers and it is contributing major online retail revenue growth to the client.
