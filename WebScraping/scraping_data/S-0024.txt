A 21st century waste collection solution
What a waste! 300 years of waste management and so little has changed.
It is time to say goodbye to waste collection trucks, overfull bins and vermin.
And say hello to Envac!
Forward thinking
Cities around the world are installing Envac systems in new and existing residential areas, historical quarters, campuses, schools, hotels, parks, banks, office buildings, financial centres and in many of the tallest high-rise buildings.
Envac is also found in many hospitals and at airports.
Envac Case studies
With many decades experience designing and installing Envac systems within a wide range of locations, Envac can add value to waste collection in urban environments regardless of location – and regardless of the development’s size.
Whilst we have over 1,000 installations in operation worldwide, find out what we have achieved for a small selection of customers around the world.
By incorporating smart waste collection technologies, Envac can help cities to achieve Goal 11.
Getting smarter
Data from the waste collection system is used for feedback to users and efficient planning.
What effects can your city expect when changing to Envac?
We interviewed our client, The City of Bergen, in Norway, to find out what immediate effects they had noted when changing from manual waste collection to Envac’s pneumatic waste collection system.

Envac’s waste collection solutions are smart, sustainable and cost-efficient.
We provide added value for property owners and ensure satisfied end-users, no matter if the system is used at home or at work.
It's not magic. Just feels like it.
In the sustainable city the waste collection takes place in a sealed system underground.
But what happens under the surface? Where does the waste go?  Let’s go underground and see how it works.
Imagine a city without waste collection trucks
It is now possible to create cities where waste collection trucks become obsolete; cities with with less noise, less traffic and lower carbon emissions.
With an Envac system in a typical residential district containing 3,500 apartments, waste collection trucks only need to spend 177 hours per year collecting waste compared with the 3,718 hours required to manually collect waste using traditional techniques.
The content in the video is based on a simulation of Stora Ursvik, a residential area in Sweden that chose Envac.
Make a long-term investment that’s worth the money
The investment costs are offset by:
Minimal manual processing results in low operating and maintenance costs
It also puts less strain on sanitation workers’ backs.
Increased property value with cleaner local environment
The space that is saved when waste storage rooms can be turned into cafes, bicycle repair shops or other businesses
An award-winning system
The City of Bergen in Norway won the Energy Globe Award 2017 for its decision to install a pneumatic waste collection system.
A smarter way to collect waste
In Stockholm’s Royal Seaport waste collection data is gathered and used to optimise the system and provide feedback to users.
Save space by converting waste storage space into cafés, bike pools and even new apartments
A pneumatic waste collection system not only reduces on-street litter, smells and the noise from waste collection trucks, but also frees up space by reducing the amount of space required for waste storage areas.
Calculations* show how developments that adopt the technology gain between 0.6 and 0.8 m2 ground floor space per apartment – space that would otherwise be allocated to waste storage
 
 
Don’t just take Envac’s word for it
With over 1,000 installations in operation there are now many Envac users across the world.
Find out what a selection of people – from Sweden to Singapore – have to say about the system.
