A combination of intuitive, self-service capabilities and AI-powered merchandising, guided selling, assisted service, and chatbots further aid the buying process and drive more profit at a lower cost of ownership.
SAP Commerce Cloud also simplifies complex commerce and order processes, so you can engage customers more effectively and connect the demand with your supply chain.
The SAP Commerce Cloud portfolio enables personalization through context-driven services, a cloud-native add-on that delivers insights through the capture and analysis of data.
You can use this information to define dynamic customer segments based on intuitive conditions. For example, if the customer is female and purchased sunglasses before, the solution can be programmed to put her into a female sunglass shopper segment. Segments can be set up and run constantly, watching and listening for customers to meet those conditions. When a customer matches a defined condition, the solution determines what the customer sees on the storefront and triggers personalized promotions or prices.
Read the solution brief to learn more about context-driven services.
Prebuilt integration is based on SAP Cloud Platform Integration Suite , which helps connect applications with other SAP and third-party cloud and on-premise applications.
Since SAP Commerce Cloud is based on open APIs, it can be quickly integrated with third-party solutions as well. We offer many prebuilt integrations to third-party solutions through SAP App Center .
