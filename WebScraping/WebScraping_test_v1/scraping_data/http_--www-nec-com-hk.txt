Business Continuity Plan – NEC’s response to COVID-19
NEC Hong Kong is closely monitoring the situation of COVID-19 and its impact on our employees, customers, partners and business.
With the health and wellbeing of everyone being our primary concern, NEC Hong Kong has been implementing several precaution measures in accordance with and in addition to the guidance by the government and the World Health Organization.
As such, among other measures, we are suggesting that certain travels, meetings, events and visits are postponed or rescheduled. While we are doing our best to ensure continuity of business and operation, your understanding and cooperation would be truly appreciated.
As the situation unfolds, further steps may be necessary and we will share updates here on our website. Should you require further clarification, please contact us at (852) 2369 0335.
