LPWAN: Cloud controlled IoT Mesh
Synap provides robust wireless communications for IoT devices such as sensors. The main bottleneck today is how to connect sensors to the network and actually get the data out at a very low cost.  We have created a secure, automatic network solution that demands no networking or programming experience to use.
The Synap IoT Mesh Network is fully managed by a cloud-based controller and our equipment is configuration free. The network is also private, only your own devices will be able to use it.

IoT Sensor Connectivity
When a new sensor is deployed and connected to a Synap modem, the network automatically recognises it and connects it to the SynapCloud controller
Our cutting edge technology provides electricity companies with the last-mile mesh connectivity to connect smart meters everywhere
