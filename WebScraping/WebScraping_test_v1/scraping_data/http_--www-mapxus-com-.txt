Think of us as the building blocks to your products — a directory, an app, or a building management software. Our indoor mapping toolkit is built for your next location-oriented product with adaptability in mind.
Digitize your indoor venue
Digitize your indoor environment to unlock the point of interest (POI) search experience with dynamic annotation added on customizable map layers. Our vector-based digital map is bandwidth- friendly and easy to access on the go, serving a functional purpose for customers and as indoor venue management.
Indoor way finding
WiFi fingerprinting has redefined and enabled an end-to-end indoor way finding experience, all without additional hardware setup. Available on various platforms and WiFi access point standards, our indoor positioning enables a seamless transition to global outdoor positioning (GPS) of users’ real-time location.
Explore in 360°
Similar to the street perspective of outdoor visual maps, our visual map enables an immersive 360° view to your indoor venue for a virtual navigation experience accessible on various devices, wherever you are. To build or maintain your visual map, simply upload a spherical photo or video from any 360° camera.
