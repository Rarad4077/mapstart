A 21st century waste collection solution
What a waste! 300 years of waste management and so little has changed.
It is time to say goodbye to waste collection trucks, overfull bins and vermin.
And say hello to Envac!
Forward thinking
Cities around the world are installing Envac systems in new and existing residential areas, historical quarters, campuses, schools, hotels, parks, banks, office buildings, financial centres and in many of the tallest high-rise buildings.
Envac is also found in many hospitals and at airports.
Envac Case studies
With many decades experience designing and installing Envac systems within a wide range of locations, Envac can add value to waste collection in urban environments regardless of location – and regardless of the development’s size.
Whilst we have over 1,000 installations in operation worldwide, find out what we have achieved for a small selection of customers around the world.
By incorporating smart waste collection technologies, Envac can help cities to achieve Goal 11.
Getting smarter
Data from the waste collection system is used for feedback to users and efficient planning.
What effects can your city expect when changing to Envac?
We interviewed our client, The City of Bergen, in Norway, to find out what immediate effects they had noted when changing from manual waste collection to Envac’s pneumatic waste collection system.
