C ) Agriculture , Fisheries and Conservation Department - Fresh Food Delivery Service Existing difficulty : There 're many local fresh food provider in HK ( e.g . fish , vegetable from local farm ) . However , the supply chain of `` Direct-from-Farm '' from farm to real consumer be still miss to attract consumer purchase fresh food from local food provider . How ShipAny increase efficiency and help : The key point of `` Direct-from-Farm '' be the chilling/temperature-controlled logistics service . ShipAny partner with HK Tier-1 chilling/temperature-controlled logistics service provider and we also operate chill smart locker . Purchasing fresh local food online and pickup at smart locker with chilling/temperature-controlled near home becomes very easy . It also help promote local fresh food and low carbon emission for purchase food from local farm . D ) Government Logistics Department - Multiple Courier Choices Existing difficulty : Government Logistics Department be coordinate logistics service for other government department . The demand of logistics demand may be bursty that Logistics Department can not always fulfil all . It 's not avoidable to outsource to external logistics service provider How ShipAny increase efficiency and help : ShipAny already connect to wide range of logistics service provider ( domestic , chilling/frozen logistics , international , locker , Circle-K ) . We provide one-stop logistics solution to save time for search and prevent single logistics vendor locked-in .

One of the propose use case for TicketME be target at popular concert hold at the Hong Kong Coliseum . Consumer flow ( for public sale ) : Similar to how consumer currently buy their ticket online , they will be able to purchase ticket via URBTIX . There be an additional option of e-ticket delivery . They will only need to input their HK mobile phone number or email address for the purchase . Once transaction be confirm , they will receive a activation link . If they haven ’ t already download an e-wallet , they will need to register with a provider with basic personal information . Their e-ticket be instantly store in their e-wallet once they can successfully answer a knowledge-authentication question . If they need to transfer any e-tickets from the e-wallet , they simply one-time upgrade their e-wallet account by upload additional identification document ( such as HKID ) to the provider . Once that be verify , they can transfer their e-tickets and collect the equivalent ( or low ) value of their ticket from the recipient via their e-wallets . Their recipient will receive a message , and they can choose to accept or reject this transfer . If they choose to accept , the e-ticket will be send to them and they can also choose to transfer this e-ticket to another recipient by upload same identification document if require . To enter the concert , consumer simply execute their e-ticket and a dynamic QR code will be generate . This be scan by a Wi-Fi connected scanner and verify at entrance . Each person will hold their own e-ticket . Once the ticket be exercise , QR code can not be generate and it be not valid for entry again . Consumer flow ( for internal subscription ) : A specific web portal will be give to event sponsor to distribute to their audience . These consumer will be able to access these allocate ticket and have the option of e-ticket delivery . The same flow applies to these ticket holder , whereby they will receive a activation link and once an e-wallet be download , they can access and transfer their e-tickets via the e-wallet . Consumer benefit : The whole flow be highly secure . Authentication be require to open the activation link that grant consumer access to their e-tickets . Additional identification be require to transfer ticket to others . E-tickets be exercise via a dynamic QR code that can not be forge or duplicate and send to others . Storage of data be minimize and encrypt with TicketME . With blockchain ’ s permanent tamper-proof ledger , this information be transparent , time-stamped and traceable . The whole experience be very simple . Consumers can transfer e-tickets to family and friend without schedule a time to meet up to exchange physical ticket . And with each person hold their own e-ticket , they can enter the concert at their own schedule , there be no need to wait for others who be hold their ticket outside the venue . The whole process be very smart . Based on the need of stakeholder and the public , various limitation can be set onto ticket transfer activity via Smart Contract . Consumer cost : There will be a small handling fee for choose the e-ticket option . This fee be comparable to the register mailing cost of physical ticket , but the benefit and convenience of have a smart e-ticket will significantly outweigh the cost ."

","In government–whether local or federal–the pressure to provide fast insight on your agency ’ s program rest squarely on your team ’ s shoulder .

Thus , a geo-distributed HCI unify the storage space across different geographical region to form a global-scale storage pool . One critical deployment requirement of a geo-distributed HCI be to maintain availability and durability guarantee in the presence of failure , range from transient failure where data be temporarily unavailable ( e.g. , power loss , network disconnection , system upgrade , reboots ) , to permanent failure where data be permanently lose ( e.g. , disk crash , sector error ) . Cloud outage be common in practice . Storing data with redundancy be a typical fault-tolerant approach , as any lost or unavailable data can be recover through the available redundant data . Traditional distributed storage system use replication to provide fault tolerance . The idea be to create multiple identical copy ( call replica ) for each data chunk and distribute the replica across different node . However , the storage overhead of replication be significant , and pose a scalability concern with the unprecedented growth of data volume .
