S-0154,Cisco Stealthwatch Encrypted Traffic Analytics,"Traditional flow monitoring provides a high-level view of network communications by reporting the addresses, ports, and byte and packet counts of a flow. In addition, intraflow metadata, or information about events that occur inside of a flow, can be collected, stored, and analyzed within a flow monitoring framework. This data is especially valuable when traffic is encrypted, because deep-packet inspection is no longer viable. This enhanced intraflow metadata is derived by using new types of data elements or telemetry that are independent of protocol details, such as the lengths and arrival times of messages within a flow. These data elements have the attractive property of applying equally well to both encrypted and unencrypted flows. Using these data elements or enhanced intraflow telemetry to identify malware communication in encrypted traffic means Cisco® Encrypted Traffic Analytics can maintain the integrity of the encrypted flow without the need for bulk decryption.

Encrypted Traffic Analytics focuses on identifying malware communications in encrypted traffic through passive monitoring, the extraction of relevant data elements, and a combination of behavioral modeling and machine learning with cloud-based global visibility.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that provides privacy for applications. TLS is usually implemented on top of common protocols such as HTTP for web browsing or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for email. HTTPS is the use of TLS over HTTP. This is the most popular way of securing communication between a web server and client and is supported by most major web servers. Encrypted Traffic Analytics extracts four main data elements: The initial data packet, the sequence of packet lengths and times, the byte distribution, and TLS-specific features.

S-0217,nCloud Fault-Tolerant Geo-distributed Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI),"To support hyper-scale storage management across multiple geographical regions, we posit that Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) should be geared towards geo-distributed deployment. A geo-distributed HCI can follow a hierarchical topology: it is composed of multiple DCs that reside in different geographical regions, in which each DC is composed of multiple nodes (or servers) for storage. Thus, a geo-distributed HCI unifies the storage space across different geographical regions to form a global-scale storage pool.

One critical deployment requirement of a geo-distributed HCI is to maintain availability and durability guarantees in the presence of failures, ranging from transient failures where data is temporarily unavailable (e.g., power loss, network disconnection, system upgrades, reboots), to permanent failures where data is permanently lost (e.g., disk crashes, sector errors). Cloud outages are common in practice. 

Storing data with redundancy is a typical fault-tolerant approach, as any lost or unavailable data can be recovered through the available redundant data. Traditional distributed storage systems use replication to provide fault tolerance. The idea is to create multiple identical copies (called replicas) for each data chunk and distribute the replicas across different nodes. However, the storage overhead of replication is significant, and poses a scalability concern with the unprecedented growth of data volume.

We present our core technology, network coding, proposed by the research team at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2000. Network coding provides a promising low-cost redundancy mechanism to achieve fault tolerance, while significantly reducing the storage overhead compared to traditional replication and achieving optimal repair performance with theoretical guarantees. It belongs to a special class of erasure coding. We first formalize the terminologies of erasure coding, and then elaborate how network coding improves the repair performance.",0.40493884682655334

S-0189,COVID19 Community Prevention Software System,"Limits COVID19 spreading while allowing normal economic and citizen day-to-day activities

1) Why COVID-19 is spreading fast?
The biggest reason why Coronavirus is so easy to spread in the community is that infected persons have an incubation period of about 14 days, and there are no obvious surface symptoms.
Many people do not know if they have been in contact with incubators. If the use of blocking strategies such as closing schools, closing in-door gym., closing movie theater, & closing the border, it can only be solved the problem in the shorter term.
In the longer-term, it not only affects the normal life of citizens but also causes huge economic losses.
 
2) The Mathematical Model of Coronavirus Spreading
Mathematically, assuming the infection rate is 2% and the average size of people gather in the public areas is 600 people.
If the community do nothing to identify the incubators and alert them not to enter public areas, in 84 days, the total infected people can grow to 3 million.
If we can block 80% of incubators, the infected number can be reduced drastically to less than 1,000.
 
3) Our System is based on the Mathematical Model
The most effective way to implement the mathematical model is to use the smartphone registration app and also to install dedicated terminals in public places such as a library, cinema, school, and gym to record where and when the citizens have visited.
When a person is reported as virus-infected by medical authorities, the system immediately puts all persons who appear in the same place at the same time as the confirmed patient into an Alert list and transmits it to all terminals.
This system gives a friendly alert to potential incubators when they are entering public areas
This is not a user tracking system !",0.3609282672405243

S-0084,NFC Product Authentication,"Customs are responsible for about 70% of all seizures of counterfeit products in the world. The role of customs is especially important in protecting the Hong Kong because the vast majority of counterfeit products are imports and, after entering the market, subject to free circulation within the community. However, in anti-counterfeiting customs role is more supportive than proactive, which means that customs mostly provide help to trademark owners to protect their IPRs when this is requested.

Customs authorities fail to seize large amounts of counterfeits either because they do not know how to recognize the fakes or because the process of gathering statements from trademark owners is too time-consuming. Proper labelling, overt anti-counterfeiting technologies and training in recognizing counterfeits would, for example, assist officials in enforcing the IPRs of affected trademark owners. Furthermore, the lack of information sharing is often perceived to be one of the main obstacles in the fight against counterfeiters. Finding counterfeit products is one part of customs responsibility to control the trade. Other control objectives include finding various kinds of dangerous materials. While controlling the trade, however, customs also work to facilitate the trade in order not to disturb import and export. These two objectives conflict and thus customs always have to balance the trade-off between control and facilitation. Taking into account also the fact that the vast majority of goods that pass through customs are legal and thus should not be disturbed, it can be seen that finding counterfeit goods is not among customs' top priorities.

Fortunately, development in technology has also enabled novel countermeasures. Most notably, the emerge of radio-frequency identification technology has opened many opportunities to fight illicit trade. NFC allows for identification of tagged objects and establishes a link between the physical world and a virtual world with a mobile phone at any place and time. This so called dual existence of objects enables a number of new ways to manage the physical world, and thus NFC is being used for example to automate many supply chain processes.",0.30486100912094116
